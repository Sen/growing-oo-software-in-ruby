  body: This method does exactly the same thing as add(), but it can be overriden by subclasses to provide on-the-fly object creations. For example, if you import a REXML::Element of name 'plop', and you have a Plop class that subclasses REXML::Element, with typed_add you can get your REXML::Element to be &quot;magically&quot; converted to Plop.
