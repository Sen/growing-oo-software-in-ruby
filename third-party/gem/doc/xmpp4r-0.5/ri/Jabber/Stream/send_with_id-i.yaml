- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Send an XMMP stanza with an Jabber::XMPPStanza#id. The id will be generated by Jabber::IdGenerator if not already set.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "The block will be called once: when receiving a stanza with the same Jabber::XMPPStanza#id. There is no need to return true to complete this! Instead the return value of the block will be returned. This is a direct result of unique request/response stanza identification via the id attribute."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The block may be omitted. Then, the result will be the response stanza.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Be aware that if a stanza with <tt>type='error'</tt> is received the function does not yield but raises an ServerError with the corresponding error element.
