- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This overwrites previous stanzas with the same destination JID to keep track of resources. Presence stanzas with <tt>type == :unavailable</tt> or <tt>type == :error</tt> will be deleted as this indicates that this resource has gone offline.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If <tt>type == :error</tt> and the presence's origin has no specific resource the contact is treated completely offline.
