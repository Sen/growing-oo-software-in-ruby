- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Class for handling roster updates
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You must do 'client.send(Iq.new_rosterget)' or else you will have nothing to put in receive_iq()
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: You must require 'xmpp4r/rosterquery' to use this class as its functionality is not needed for a working XMPP implementation. This will make [IqQuery] convert all Queries with namespace 'jabber:iq:roster' to [IqQueryRoster]
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This &lt;query/&gt; contains multiple &lt;item/&gt; children. See RosterItem.
