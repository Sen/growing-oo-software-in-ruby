- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Ask the users specified by jids for authorization (i.e., ask them to add you to their contact list). If you are already in the user's contact list, add() will not attempt to re-request authorization. In order to force re-authorization, first remove() the user, then re-add them.

  body: "  jabber_simple.add(&quot;friend@friendosaurus.com&quot;)\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Because the authorization process might take a few seconds, or might never happen depending on when (and if) the user accepts your request, results are placed in the Jabber::Simple#new_subscriptions queue.
